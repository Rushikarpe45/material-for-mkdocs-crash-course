**12.1 What does trust look like in a team?**

A team where everyone trusts one another is characterized by a high level of cooperation and collaboration, as well as mutual respect. Members feel safe to voice their opinions without fear of criticism or judgment, knowing that their thoughts are valued and respected. 

They are comfortable with each otherâ€™s skills, abilities, and expertise, allowing for easier problem-solving, and faster iteration.
When no one's ego comes first, it becomes possible to base your discussions purely on the merits of ideas, smoothing (and hastening) the process of arriving at the best outcomes.

**12.2 Levels of trust:**

When building and maintaining trust within a team, it is important to recognize that there are different levels of trust. Obviously, this isn't a definitive list, but the levels can largely be broken down into three distinct categories.

In team building, trust can be understood and categorized into different levels based on the depth and extent of trust that exists within the team. These levels of trust can help assess the quality of relationships and collaboration within the team. Here are some common levels of trust in team building:

**1. Basic Trust:**

This is the foundational level of trust where team members exhibit a basic level of trust in each other's intentions and abilities. It involves the belief that team members will act in good faith and fulfill their responsibilities.

**2. Relational Trust:**

 Relational trust goes beyond basic trust and involves a deeper level of connection and rapport among team members. It is characterized by mutual respect, empathy, and understanding, as well as a willingness to support and collaborate with one another.

**3. Emotional Trust:**

Emotional trust involves a high degree of vulnerability and emotional openness among team members. It is built on a foundation of empathy, compassion, and authenticity, allowing team members to express their thoughts, feelings, and concerns without fear of judgment or rejection.

**4. Competence Trust:** 

Competence trust is based on the belief that team members possess the necessary skills, knowledge, and expertise to perform their roles effectively. It involves confidence in each other's capabilities and a willingness to rely on one another's judgment and expertise.

**5. Predictive Trust:** 

Predictive trust emerges when team members consistently demonstrate reliability, consistency, and predictability in their behavior and actions. It involves the expectation that team members will follow through on their commitments and deliver on their promises.
