**2.4 Why Do You Need to Consider Team Dynamics?**

**The answer is simple** —

group or team dynamics defines how effective your team is going to be in their work performance and generating new ideas. As a result, it influences the overall project outcome. 

The good thing about team dynamics is that if you know its parameters and monitor them, you can influence them. This way, if one of your projects started badly, you can do something about it by trying to change the team dynamics rather than observing your project slowly going off the rails.

Project managers and human resource managers strive to create positive group dynamics in teams. It means that team members trust each other, are ready to work collectively, provide support, and productively brainstorm ideas, and listen to other group members. 

In groups with positive dynamics, team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and having a constructive dialogue. 

Whereas groups with poor dynamics disrupt work processes and fail to achieve positive results just by repeatedly making poor decisions that lead to even poorer choices. 

All of these generate negative conflicts inside a team, making each participant feel vulnerable and unwilling to share their ideas. 

The craziest thing about poor team dynamics is that even if your team consists of world-class professionals, the result of their collaboration will be far from perfection (at best) or just a downright disaster.


**2.5 Examples of Team Dynamics:**

Surely, every business owner and each team leader wants to create only dynamic teams that develop positively and reach their goal. But, for this, they need to learn how to recognize the signs of a positive team dynamic. Here are some examples of team dynamics done right:

Open communication. When team members are willing to discuss issues and problems throughout a project.
Alignment. When each team member understands their duties in the project, overall project objectives, and project development direction.

Conflict resolution. When each participant feels comfortable enough to resolve conflicts through discussion or take it to the group for public discussion.

Commitment to the project. When each team member is deeply involved in the project and feels at ease to share their ideas on how to improve it.

Optimistic thinking. When participants are ready to commit to the project even when everything is going wrong.
