**7. Communication and Understanding:**

Effective communication and understanding are integral to social connection. Sharing thoughts, feelings, and experiences with others enhances mutual understanding and strengthens bonds.

Reciprocity is a process of exchanging things with other people to gain a mutual benefit. The norm of reciprocity (sometimes referred to as the rule of reciprocity) is a social norm where, if someone does something for you, you then feel obligated to return the favour.

**8. Adaptability and Resilience:**

- Socially connected individuals often demonstrate greater adaptability and resilience in the face of life's challenges. The support of a network provides a buffer against stress and adversity.

Reciprocity is a crucial aspect of how people interact and live in society but researchers who study these interactions have often overlooked its importance. Reciprocity, as a fundamental principle in social psychology, revolves around the concept that individuals tend to respond to the actions of others in a manner that mirrors the positive or negative nature of those actions.

 It involves a mutual exchange of behaviors and reactions, where individuals reciprocate the same type of behavior they have received from others. 

People's choices in how they behave are mostly based on what they can gain from others in return, while feelings of trust, liking, and togetherness are strongly influenced by the idea of giving and receiving equally.

In social psychology, reciprocity is a social norm of responding to a positive action with another positive action, rewarding kind actions.
 As a social construct, reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer and much more cooperative than predicted by the self-interest model; conversely, in response to hostile actions they are frequently much more nasty and even brutal.

Reciprocity makes it possible to build sustainable and continuing relationships with reciprocal exchanges. Francis Fukuyama states that “If the institutions of democracy and capitalism are to work properly, they must coexist within certain premodern cultural habits that ensure their proper functioning” . 

He goes on to say “Law, contract, and economic rationality and prosperity…. must as well be leavened with reciprocity, moral obligation, duty toward community, and trust…. The latter are not anachronisms in a modern society but rather the sine qua non of the latter’s success”  According to the sociologist Alvin Gouldner , this norm is nearly universal, and only a few members of society—the very young, the sick, or the old—are exempt from it.

The R-Model was developed as a theory sustainable healthy relationships with reciprocal elements at its core. The theory explains the need for reciprocity is necessary for the relationship to be sustainable and health. without reciprociity the relationship is considered leas sustainable and less healthy. The author of the R-Model explains the need for balance in a relationship, and with balance there can be even growth in the relationship.
