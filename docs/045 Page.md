**Roles and Responsibilities**

Roles and responsibilities refer to the specific tasks, duties, and expectations assigned to individuals or positions within an organization, team, or project. Defining roles and responsibilities is crucial for establishing clarity, accountability, and effective coordination among team members. It ensures that everyone understands their contributions to the overall objectives and helps prevent confusion or overlapping efforts. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

**9.1 Roles:**

**9.1.1 Definition:**

A role is a set of responsibilities, tasks, and expectations assigned to an individual based on their position or function within a team or organization.

A role is a set of connected behaviors, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. It is an expected or free or continuously changing behavior and may have a given individual social status or social position.

Role, in sociology, the behaviour expected of an individual who occupies a given social position or status. A role is a comprehensive pattern of behaviour that is socially recognized, providing a means of identifying and placing an individual in a society. 

It also serves as a strategy for coping with recurrent situations and dealing with the roles of others (e.g., parent–child roles). The term, borrowed from theatrical usage, emphasizes the distinction between the actor and the part. 

A role remains relatively stable even though different people occupy the position: any individual assigned the role of physician, like any actor in the role of Hamlet, is expected to behave in a particular way. An individual may have a unique style, but this is exhibited within the boundaries of the expected behaviour.

Role expectations include both actions and qualities: a teacher may be expected not only to deliver lectures, assign homework, and prepare examinations but also to be dedicated, concerned, honest, and responsible. 

Individuals usually occupy several positions, which may or may not be compatible with one another: one person may be husband, father, artist, and patient, with each role entailing certain obligations, duties, privileges, and rights vis-à-vis other persons. See also social status.
 

**9.1.2 Characteristics:**

 Roles define what each team member is expected to do, the scope of their work, and their specific contributions to the team's goals.

The characteristics of roles within a team or organization outline the key attributes that define how individuals contribute to the overall functioning and success of the group. These characteristics help establish clarity, accountability, and effective coordination. 

Understanding and embracing these characteristics contribute to a well-functioning team or organization, fostering a positive work environment, effective collaboration, and the achievement of shared goals.
