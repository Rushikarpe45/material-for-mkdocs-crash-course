**4. Conduct team-building activities:**

When people get to know each other better and have the opportunity to work together in a relaxed setting, they are more likely to develop a trusting relationship.

Team-building activities help to improve communication. By participating in fun and interactive exercises, team members learn how to communicate more effectively with each other. This can lead to improved productivity and collaboration on projects.

Also, team-building activities can enhance morale and motivation. When team members feel appreciated and supported by their colleagues, they are more likely to be productive and motivated in their work.

**5. Hold regular one-on-one meetings to check in:**

While it may seem counterintuitive in a team context, one-on-one meetings and check-ins are essential for building trust in a team. This is because they provide an opportunity for team members to communicate openly and candidly with their manager, share updates, and discuss ways to resolve any conflicts that may have arisen.

Additionally, one-on-one meetings provide a chance for team members to discuss their progress and give feedback to their leader. This helps leaders identify any potential issues or areas of improvement and allows them to address these problems before they become bigger problems.

**6. Communicate effectively:**

Communication is key to any successful relationship, and the same holds true for relationships among team members. 
Good communication allows team members to share information, but great communication leads to a better understanding of each other's roles and responsibilities, and how to bring together everyone's unique skills to accomplish your goals more quickly, and in more innovative ways.

In order to communicate effectively, team members need to be able to listen attentively and without judgment. They also need to be willing to express their opinions openly and honestly. By communicating respectfully and constructively, team members can build trust and cooperation within the team.

**7. Be the first to admit when you're wrong:**

It's easy to get defensive when things don't go according to plan. As a leader, however, it is important to take responsibility for your actions and admit when you're wrong. 
This shows team members that you are open to feedback and willing to learn from your mistakes. Doing this will also foster a growth mindset, where failure is not defining and instead regarded as a natural part of the learning process.

**8. Show appreciation for each team member's contribution:**

No one can achieve success on their own â€” it takes a team. And when a team is successful, it's because everyone has contributed in some way.

That's why it's so important to recognize the contributions of everyone on your team, across all skill areas and departments. When people feel appreciated and valued for their contributions, they are more likely to be motivated and productive in their work.

Acknowledging the successes of every team member is also important. It builds morale and helps to create a sense of camaraderie among coworkers. When people feel like they're part of a winning team, they're more likely to be committed to achieving even greater things together.
