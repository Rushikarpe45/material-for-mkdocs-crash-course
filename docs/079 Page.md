**12.4 ways to build team trust:**

**1. Set expectations and boundaries:**

Setting expectations and boundaries within a team is an important step in building trust. Having clear guidelines on how team members should communicate and behave with each other allows everyone to feel comfortable and safe in their work environment. 

Establishing boundaries helps everyone better understand their roles, responsibilities, and expectations by providing structure, consistency, and stability. Setting expectations also centers the overall goals of the project, which increases productivity.

**2. Create a space for psychological safety:**

Open communication is essential to building trust in a team. Encourage everyone to communicate openly and honestly with each other, without fear of judgment or criticism. Make sure that all voices are heard and respected so that everyone feels comfortable.

Being vulnerable in a team setting is an essential part of building trust. By being open and honest about our flaws, mistakes, and challenges, we can create an environment of transparency where team members feel free to express their ideas and opinions without fear of judgment or repercussions.
Vulnerability also encourages collaboration and understanding among team members, as they can relate to each other and work together to find solutions.

**3. Demonstrate transparency:**

As a team leader, it's important to share information with your team openly and honestly, and be willing to listen to their feedback. It also means being willing to admit when you're wrong and taking responsibility for your mistakes.

 When team members feel like they can trust you, they'll be more likely to work cooperatively with you and support your decisions.
