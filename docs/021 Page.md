## **Role of Team Leader in Team Building**

**5.1 Leadership**

A single brain sometimes cannot take decisions alone. One needs the assistance and guidance of others as well to accomplish the tasks within the desired time frame. In a team, every member contributes to his level best to achieve the assigned targets. The team members must be compatible with each other to avoid unnecessary conflicts and misunderstandings.

Every team should have a team leader who can hold his team together and extract the best out of the team members. The team leader should be such that every individual draws inspiration from him and seek his advice and guidance whenever required. He should be a role model for his team members.

A team leader plays an important role in guiding the team members and motivating them to stay focused.
A team leader is one who sets a goal and objective for the team. Every team is formed for a purpose. 

The leader alone should not set the goal, suggestions should be invited from one and all and issues must be discussed on an open forum. He must make his team members well aware of their roles and responsibilities. 

He must understand his team members well. The duties and responsibilities must be assigned as per their interest and specialization for them to accept the challenge willingly. Never impose things on them.

**5.2 A team leader must be impartial**

 He should support one and all equally. Partiality leads to negativity and conflicts among the team members. Don’t favour anyone just because he is your friend.

As a team leader, one should constantly motivate his team members. Motivate them so that they perform even better the next time. Avoid criticizing anyone. Never make fun of anyone’s mistakes, instead correct him in a polite way.

Encourage the team members to help each other. Create a positive ambience at the workplace. Avoid playing politics or provoking individuals to fight. Make sure that the team members do not fight among themselves.

 In case of a conflict, don’t add fuel to the fire, rather try to resolve the fight immediately. Listen to both the parties before coming to any conclusion. Try to come to an alternative feasible for all.
