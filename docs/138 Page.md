**Introduction and Icebreaking:** 

The team gathers for an introductory meeting facilitated by the team leader or project manager. Each member introduces themselves, sharing their background, skills, and experiences. Icebreaking activities may be conducted to foster a more relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

**Goal Clarification:**
The team leader outlines the project goals, objectives, and timelines. They discuss the importance of the project and its alignment with the company’s overall strategy. The team members ask questions to gain a better understanding of the project’s scope and expectations.

Role Assignment: The team leader assigns specific roles and responsibilities to each team member based on their skills and expertise. This may involve discussing individual strengths and areas of focus. The team members may also express their preferences and suggestions for roles they believe they are well-suited for.

**Establishing Communication Channels:** 

The team establishes communication protocols and determines the frequency and mode of communication. They discuss how they will collaborate, share information, and address any challenges that may arise. This could involve setting up regular team meetings, choosing a communication platform, and defining preferred communication methods.

**Building Trust:** 

As the team members start working together, they begin to build trust and rapport. They may engage in informal conversations, share personal experiences, and find common ground. Team-building activities or social events might be organized to foster better relationships and teamwork.

**Forming Norms:**

 The team members start to develop group norms and expectations regarding communication, decision-making, and accountability. They discuss how they will resolve conflicts, make decisions, and hold each other accountable. This stage is crucial for establishing a shared understanding of how the team will function.

**Tip:**
 If you want to support your team during this stage, encourage conversations about each member’s skills, backgrounds, and interests. Collaboratively establish goals, timelines, and ground rules.

**2. Team is Storming**

Once the team members get to know each other, they move on to the second stage. Storming is the most difficult of the five stages, as the team has to learn how to work together despite their individual personalities.

As the team members already know about everyone’s individual skills and backgrounds, they must start searching for a way to collaborate and progress.
