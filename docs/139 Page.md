In this stage, it is common for teams to have several divided groups, each of them with its own informal leader. Such groups are normally formed around different working methods or overall goals. However, the whole team must find a consensus on both to progress further.

Due to the contesting views, the team productivity either stays the same as in the Forming stage or decreases. It is important the team solves all the underlying issues so that it can improve productivity and avoid long-term problems in the future.

**Tip:** 
Help your team in the Storming stage by letting everyone have a say. Listen to all sides of each conflict and facilitate a middle ground that allows the team to move forward. Define the communication rules to help your team with any conflicts in the future and establish collaboration tools to facilitate the change.

**3. Team is Norming**

As the team works out the majority or all of their issues, they form a sense of unity and a common goal, thus entering the Norming stage.

With most of the issues being solved, the team starts to standardize their work practices and solidify roles. There are no more groups within the team and instead, they all work in a unit with a clear leader. 

Due to this, work efficiency increases and becomes the highest since the beginning of the team development cycle.

The Norming stage is the first indication that the team is going in the right direction, but the unity at this stage is still very fragile. The Storming stage is characterized by conflicts, power struggles, and a lack of clarity, which can significantly impact productivity and team dynamics. 

If new issues arise and the team fails to solve them, they can return to the Storming stage and thus reduce their productivity again.

**Tip:**

Help your team in the Norming stage by setting individual roles for the team members and defining tools to deal with sticky situations. Recognize the value of everyone on the team. This requires open and honest communication, active problem-solving, and a commitment to resolving conflicts constructively.
