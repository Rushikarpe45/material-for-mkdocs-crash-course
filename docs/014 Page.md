**3.4 Build trust and strengthen relationships**

Trust is essential to teams. To achieve great performance, colleagues must depend on each other. Teammates must believe that other group members will complete the work quickly and correctly. Team members must also feel comfortable confronting other teammates and approaching teammates for help.

 Employees who feel comfortable with colleagues take more creative risks and report higher levels of satisfaction. Not to mention, trusting colleagues waste little time questioning teammate’s intentions or second-guessing others’ work.

One way to foster trust is by strengthening the relationships between teammates. Forming emotional connections makes us more likely to trust. After all, when we interact regularly with individuals, those folks are likely to act in our best interests to maintain the bond. Also, forming relationships means recognizing different personality facets and understanding our colleagues on a deeper level.

You can facilitate relationships on your team by creating opportunities for natural interactions like casual coffee chats or team dinners. You can also engage in relationship-building team building activities such as storytelling workshops and common traits.

**3.5 Cultivate a culture of cooperation**


Employees need to work together to achieve success. Organizations are not groups of individuals working solo, but rather teams collaborating towards a shared goal. Teams must adopt an “us” mentality to thrive in the modern workplace. Otherwise, employees will not utilize all the resources at their disposal.

As a leader, you should acclimate your crew to a teamwork culture. Some of your employees may have always acted alone, and may need time to get used to depending on other group members.

You can encourage cooperation by gently deferring questions and tasks to other team members. For instance, you can say, “Janice is a compliance superstar. She could explain this much better than I can, and I’m sure she’d be happy to help!”

You can also play collaboration-centric  team building games like scavenger hunts, escape rooms, and improv games. Team building board games are a vastly underrated cooperation-based activity. Cooperative gaming teaches players to join forces against the game instead of competing against each other.
