## **Conclusion**

Team building is an invaluable resource for organizations seeking to enhance productivity and cultivate a positive work environment. It promotes collaboration, problem-solving abilities, and knowledge-sharing among team members, resulting in increased productivity and improved overall team performance.

Team building is not just about bringing individuals together; it's about creating a cohesive unit that is greater than the sum of its parts. A deep conclusion on team building underscores its profound impact on organizational success, employee satisfaction, and the fulfillment of collective goals.

The initial aim of this study was to investigate the effect team building exercises have on performance.

**16.1 The research hypothesis is as follows:**

Team building exercises (independent variable) will have a significant positive implication on the effectiveness, efficiency, morale or productivity within major blue-chip companies (dependent variable).
Qualitative primary research was used to assess the experiences of five major blue-chip companies.

Interviews were used to collect qualified, meaningful evidence.

The research hypothesis has been proven correct, recognising the relationship between team building and performance changes.

This study has proved conclusive and does support literature within the unexplored field, however there are limitations to the study.

**16.2 Limitations:**

Only five companies interviewed, this could have been broader to collaborate more significant results and trends.

One team building provider, more providers with ranging styles of events would portray more reliable findings.

Time restraints, if all of the events took place at the same time and interviews were completed at monthly intervals following the event, the results would have greater implications.

Some of the managers participated in the events while others observed. this may have affected the results. In future studies this should be controlled, either all of the managers observe or all of them participate.

**16.3 Strengths:**
Top end managers were interviewed. 

Qualitative research was gained providing in-depth useful information.

A range of events were experienced displaying the broad effect of several team building exercises. 
The research was backed up by secondary sources.

This qualitative research showed that in the well planned events, the team building exercise had a significant positive effect on performance, while events with less planning and consideration had a satisfactory or negative effect on performance.
