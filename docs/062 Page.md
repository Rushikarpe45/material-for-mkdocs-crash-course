**9. Cultural and Social Identity:**

 Social connection involves the formation and maintenance of cultural and social identities. Individuals often find a sense of purpose and meaning in their connections with communities that share common values, traditions, or interests.

Constructions of identity–who I am and who we are–shape the cultural landscape and are central to political alignments and advocacy across the socio-economic spectrum. Centering the study of people as individuals, communities and societies, Cultural & Social Identities (CSI) investigates how identities shape social relations and cultural flows between local and global contexts. 

Drawing from tools of the social sciences (anthropology, sociology, psychology, geography, education, linguistics) and the humanities (art, literature, media studies, philosophy), CSI examines how groups and individuals make meaning, construct social relations, and distribute power. 

CSI courses analyze the building-blocks of identity, such as values, naming, branding, group affiliations and behaviors, and group politics and modes of expression. We introduce students to effective research methods and practices, including analysis of culture and politics, observations of public life and space, and in-depth interviews and focus groups. Our graduates are well-poised to pursue careers in a wide variety of fields including, law, education, psychology, journalism, marketing, public relations, and public policy. 

**10. Technological Impact:**

In the modern era, technology has expanded the possibilities for social connection. Digital platforms, social media, and online communities offer new avenues for individuals to connect, share experiences, and maintain relationships across geographical distances.

Understanding and fostering social connection is essential for creating a supportive and enriching social environment. Whether in personal relationships, work settings, or community interactions, recognizing the significance of social connections contributes to the overall well-being and fulfillment of individuals.

Another tool from technology that boosts teamwork and collaboration is project management. It can be difficult to schedule project meetings and keep track of deadlines with teams spread across multiple organisations. But by using project collaboration software, these are managed in one platform.
