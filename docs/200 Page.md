This is important because it is lack of understanding between employees is a key cause of destructive processes in the company, which leads to loss of valuable employees, emergence of resistance, loss of information. 

Also team building teaches participants to interact more effectively with each other, to trust and understand each other. Due to this, it is possible to significantly reduce the level of conflict, because it allows to develop different solutions to problems.

Team building can change the roles in the team structure. An effective team means that each member is able to take on multiple roles, which are functional at the same time (generator of ideas, critic, analyst, etc.). In addition, it is worth noting that team building does not imply the presence of destructive roles (an outcast). The team must solve the problems by offsetting weakness, rather than looking for culprits. In an effective team the general and personal potential of all participants must be used.

The degree of success of training depends on the coach and its members. The coach has the right to establish a process, to be an expert and hold certain knowledge. His task is the process of achieving results, and team task is a result itself. Team building can be of various kinds: in the game form, sports activities (pinball, bowling tournament, etc.) and business strategy. 

The range of team building activities is quite wide and varied. But the essence of any of them is to rally a team through joint activities to overcome the difficulties, to resolve situations that require a collective unity and support, members’ transition from “I” to “we”, that is, to the team.

At the same time, informal communication leads to a psychological relaxation. Knowing this feature, the coach will pick up the necessary exercises for team building.

Teams are formed of 5-10 people, depending on the size of the group. It is better if the team will be formed randomly, it will strengthen the psychological relaxation.
Each team must choose a captain, come up with the team name and motto, which will be used throughout the training.

Teams throughout the training will participate in different sport competitions that require team actions, play paintball, volleyball, soccer, etc.

At the end of the training teams are invited to discuss their activities at various stages of training, evaluate them, summarize. The winners receive awards and other participants – prizes for memory.
The result of such a corporate training is psychological relaxation and team building, resolution of conflicts and reduction of tension in the team. If managers and leaders participate in team building, it will help to increase trust to them of other employees.

In conclusion we can say that team building is the most effective way to improve relationships between team members, improve the climate in the team, improve mutual understanding and trust of its members, as well as resolve conflicts.
