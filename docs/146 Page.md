As Kendra Grant pointed out in describing her work with Walmart, many barriers to improvement that are thought to be internal to learners are really external — they’re flaws in the design. UDL helps us focus on what works for people rather than on what’s not working in them. By providing the right context and supporting capacity, we can make expert learning become the skill that fills the skills gap.


**16.1.4 Feedback Mechanisms:** 

Feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in continuous improvement. These mechanisms can take various forms, such as regular performance reviews, team retrospectives, surveys, or informal feedback sessions. By soliciting input from team members, leaders can gain valuable insights into areas that require improvement and identify potential solutions collaboratively.

**About this course:**
 A feedback mechanism provides the means for you to track personal performance. It should be used to improve your performance in the future. 

If your job involves sales, managing budgets and production, your success can usually be measured in numbers. 

So, a Feedback Mechanism will be an indicator that highlights your performance in numbers. What if you are a leader? Your performance could be judged on more abstract terms such as how your interpersonal skills are evolving.

 If you are a leader, often the main source of feedback will be through performance reviews and sources of this information will come from your manager and your peers. Keep in mind this feedback promotes personal and professional growth.

 There may be positive and negative feedback but always keep in mind that these are just our indicators and will help us to improve. 
 Remember also that the feedback mechanism is a two-way process.
 As a leader you give feedback to your team and you will also encourage your team members to open up and voice their opinions about your leadership. Note that you should always make arrangements to have regular feedback sessions.

 Today, we will be learning different ways to obtain feedback on your performance in the workplace and understanding the importance of feedback mechanisms.
 
 Once the session is completed, you will be able to define the meaning of a feedback mechanism, identify the different ways of getting feedback on performance in the workplace and explain the importance of a feedback mechanisms in leadership and team building.
