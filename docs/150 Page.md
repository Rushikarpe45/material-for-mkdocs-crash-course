**16.2.1 What is continuous improvement?**

Continuous improvement is the process of making small incremental changes that add up to significant results based on deliberate observation of current processes.

Also known as Kaizen, the continuous improvement method originated in Japan. Today, it’s been adopted by businesses across the globe as a way to achieve operational excellence.

The main idea behind continuous improvement is that no process is perfect and there is always room for improvement. The goal is to squeeze out waste, optimize resources, and empower employees to make changes that improve the company's bottom line.

Process improvement consultant Brian Ragone says it is "system thinking where we build feedback loops so we get information from current processes and reflect on how to improve them."

**Ragone says the focus of continuous improvement is three-fold:**

Improving tools and materials
Improving people and relationships
Improving the work environment

That often means removing bloated tools. Other times, it's improving documentation about how you work, so anyone can come in and get started immediately. It’s also upskilling your people. Finally, it's removing barriers from communication or just friction in work relationships.

Finally, it’s improving the physical, and psychological safety of your people at work.

Continuous improvement is a systematic and ongoing process of enhancing products, services, or processes incrementally over time. 

It involves identifying areas for improvement, making changes, evaluating their impact, and then further refining or iterating upon those changes. Continuous improvement is based on the philosophy that even if something is functioning well, there is always room for enhancement to make it better.
