**16.2.5.2 Identify the root cause of problems**

Once you know where your process breaks down, it’s time to find out why. To identify the root cause of a problem, ask these five questions:

What happened?
When did it happen?
Who was involved?
What were they doing?
What were the conditions under which it happened?

Using these prompts, we may discover that:

Leads fill our demo request form but never showed up
A week after they filled out the form

The lead, our CRM, and our sales team were involved

The lead filled out the form, our CRM notified us of a new lead, and our sales team qualified the lead and sent an invite to them for the call

Leads wait two days to receive an invite
From this analysis, we can spot two areas as potential root causes: the demo call invites wait time, and the tone of the invitation.

**16.2.5.3 Develop a solution**

Now that you know where your process is breaking down and why, you can create a plan to address the problem.
This plan should involve the people who are responsible for the steps in your process. Brainstorm potential solutions and then choose the one that promises to be most effective.
