**16.2.2.2 Do: Testing solutions**


Once you've identified an opportunity and determined how best to address it through change, implement that change on a small scale. We do this to objectively measure its effectiveness.

For the email sequence example above, that may mean only emailing a small percentage of leads (20% for example).

Testing solutions in team building is crucial for ensuring their effectiveness and suitability for the organization. Here's how you can approach it:

**1. Pilot Projects:** 

Implement the proposed solutions on a small scale or in a controlled environment to test their feasibility and impact before full-scale implementation. This allows teams to assess how well the solutions work in practice and identify any necessary adjustments.

**2. Feedback Loops:** 

Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from team members involved in testing the solutions. Encourage open communication and constructive feedback to understand what is working well and what needs improvement.

**3. Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

Define specific metrics and KPIs that align with the goals of the team building initiatives. Monitor these indicators during the testing phase to measure the effectiveness of the solutions and track progress over time.

**4. Continuous Evaluation:**

Continuously evaluate the performance of the solutions throughout the testing phase. Be prepared to iterate and make adjustments based on the feedback received and the data collected.
