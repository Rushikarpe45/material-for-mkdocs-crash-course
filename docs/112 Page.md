**2. Bring People Together**
Once you've got a better understanding of the conflict and everyone's perspectives, it's time to bring the relevant parties together and act as a moderator.

Set some ground rules before getting the conversation underway. Encourage team members to listen to one another, respect each other's points of view, and not interrupt or make personal comments. During the conversation:

Keep the tone of the conversation calm and non-threatening.

Encourage active listening, so people understand where the other person is coming from.
Encourage individuals to share ideas. What do they want or need? What would they be prepared to commit to? Have them to brainstorm some solutions.

Ask them about situations where they've worked well together in the past. See if they can build on those positive experiences.

If the discussion becomes heated, take a break and reconvene when everyone's had a chance to calm down. Be alert for any passive-aggressive behavior.

**3. Ask the Wider Team for Ideas**
When a conflict affects the whole team, provided it's not sensitive or confidential, you can ask for everyone's perspective.

Talking things out helps you and your team to consider different assumptions, beliefs, and decision-making approaches. This can also be a part of creating a "psychologically safe" environment, where people feel comfortable sharing ideas and concerns, thus preventing future conflicts.

**4. Draw up a Plan**
Ask the parties to detail agreed-on actions for reconciliation. And get each to commit to this strategy. You can draw up a timetable for actions, ticking them off as and when they are achieved. Hold all relevant parties accountable.

**5. Follow up**
Ensure that issues have been resolved properly by following up on the situation. For example, people may still feel irritated but not want to drag things out. You can use one-on-ones to prevent old disagreements from resurfacing. And try an anonymous team survey to get feedback and uncover any lingering frustrations.

Seek Guidance and Support
When you're faced with a challenging conflict in your team and are unsure how to handle it, seek support from a trusted colleague, your line manager, or your HR department.

If your efforts at conflict resolution don't work, you'll need to be willing to pursue formal procedures if necessary. And some situations, such as harassment, discrimination or bullying, require a formal disciplinary process to be followed. In these instances, or if you are in any doubt, liaise with your HR team for advice.
