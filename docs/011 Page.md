**2.11 Build communication**

Transparency and effective communication help teams achieve their goals successfully and much easier. Though, not every team member has developed communication skills by default. You could use various techniques to encourage your employees to work on their communication skills. 

For example, you can use self-advocacy development techniques, group decision-making development methods, or just team-building games to enhance collaboration and interpersonal relationships among team participants. 

In case your team works remotely during the pandemic or due to work specifics, you can teach your team how to build effective remote communication. 

**-Follow stages of group development**

Every group passes more or less the same stages of group development. This way you can foresee and prevent possible difficulties each team member can face in the group and channel team dynamics in the right way. It’ll help you to avoid lots of issues in the early stages of your group forming and prevent them along the working process. 

**2.12 What Tools Are Out There to Assist in Improving Team Dynamics?**
We wholeheartedly believe that the right time-tracking software + project management platform help to keep everyone filled in, focused on their tasks, and, consequently, boost accountability.

**For example:** 

Everhour prevents employee burnout, thus promoting a healthier work environment, and excludes overlapping vacation time so that departments aren’t understaffed. Likewise, project management software provides employees with a central hub where they can track and assign tasks, keep calendars, and monitor shared goals.
