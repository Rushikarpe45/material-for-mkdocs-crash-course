Existing research emphasizes the importance of trust and team building. Trust is a crucial factor for team performance; without trust, team members are not willing to voice their opinions, questions, and improvement ideas. Also team members do not display their feelings and they are not willing to help others. All these aspects are crucial in co-creation of business networks and in the building of high-performing teams.

The preliminary results of our study reinforce the insights from the literature and contribute further insights relating to trust in high-performing teams and within business ecosystems. In particular, these results highlight the importance of sharing critical information and having a high level of communication through constant interaction. We are looking forward to find out what further insights our ongoing study may reveal.

Team building activities are a wonderful tool to boost the quality and health of your team. However, despite all the benefits that team building can bring if done right, there are some potential disadvantages.  

To be clear, by disadvantages we simply mean that not every team building activity is right for every team. The choices of team building activities today are practically unlimited, and each activity has its positive and negative aspects. Teams need to assess their needs, limitations, and constraints when choosing the right team building program. 

We believe that there are solutions to every problem and that in the end it is always worth it to invest in your team, even when you have little leeway in terms of budget or time. Knowing about disadvantages can lead to making positive, proactive decisions about team building that allow you to reap the advantages. 

In this blog post we will go over the advantages and disadvantages of team building, as well as possible solutions. Hopefully, this will make you more aware of the considerations going into team building activities, and how to make the most of your team building experience. 

**Team building activities can be very expensive:**

Team building events can be quite costly and if you want to spend money, the sky’s the limit. You might feel the pressure to spend more money on blowout events or high-priced group trips. Of course, only very few companies in the world have the budget to fly their teams to a tropical island retreat for team building. 

In reality, there are many more affordable options that will probably be as effective, if not more so. Smaller events with teams might be better than huge events. Likewise, expensive training sessions and coaches may not be what your team really needs. You have to weigh the costs against what the program provides and what your team is looking for.

And if your budget is really tight, we still recommend implementing some sort of team building. This can be organized on your own–small group chats, outdoor picnics, impromptu office parties or lectures, etc. No matter what you can afford, putting in the effort into team building now will greatly benefit your team down the line.


**Team building activities are time consuming and need to be held regularly:**

Team building exercises can be very time consuming both in their planning and execution. Also, it should be kept in mind that one single event will not have the long lasting effects that you may want–team building is a constant effort that needs to be worked on regularly. 

The time-consuming nature of team building exercises might be a serious concern for you and your team. You might not think that your team has any time to spend on team building, or that team building will take away time from more “productive” tasks.

In reality, team building is an excellent use of time and will help your team be more productive later on. However, the stereotype that team building is a waste of time comes from the fact that sometimes teams choose activities that are not worth the team’s time. 

So the number one solution is to find activities that will be beneficial and help your team. This requires a good assessment of where your team is at and where it wants to go.
In terms of concerns about lack of time, team building can really be done anytime. We talked above about doing shorter events, which will help make team building more regular, and cut down on long, extensive programs.

You can also do team building in the evening, on weekends or on a holiday. Granted, this is not how everyone wants to spend their free time. But again, that’s why finding the right activity (with the right amount of fun) for your team matters. When team members are enjoying themselves during an event, they will forget that what they are doing is related to work. If teams emerge strong and happy after a team building event, the extra time spent is well worth it.
