**3.2 Clarify roles and responsibilities**

Each team member has a role to play, but those roles must be clear for your teams to succeed. If every member of a baseball team chased after the ball, then a game would devolve into chaos. Similarly, if your team members are unsure of responsibilities, employees may duplicate work or miss tasks.

Clarifying roles cuts down on conflict and eliminates stress and frustration. When teams understand the part of each individual player, teammates can confidently tackle tasks and produce timely results. As the Harvard Business Review notes, collaboration increases when roles are unambiguous.

To clarify roles, introduce team members and highlight each teammate’s position, skills, and experience. At the start of each project, either assign tasks or oversee the team’s delegation of duties. You should always be aware of team member responsibilities to ensure an even workflow distribution.

 You can always reallocate tasks and send help as necessary during projects, but establishing clear positions helps everyone set realistic expectations and stay on track.

**3.3 Encourage communication**

Communication is an important part of teamwork. Teams that communicate effectively waste less time and are more productive. Turnaround time improves when teammates respond quickly and concisely.

 When teammates can convey an idea or a vision, other teammates can follow instructions without circling back for clarification. Good conversation skills also decrease conflict, as employees are less likely to misunderstand or misinterpret clear messages.

Discussion is also one of the most effective team building tools. Casual conversations build rapport and camaraderie among teammates, forming bonds and fostering trust among your team.

For these reasons, establishing lines of communication should be one of the first steps you should take when building your teams.

You should also ensure that your team has the means to communicate, especially if the team is remote. You can set up your teams with communication software such as Slack, Blink, or Asana, and provide additional contact information for all team members.
