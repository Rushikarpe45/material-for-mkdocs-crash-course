**16.2.5 The six steps in continuous improvement**

There are many ways to impement continuous improvement in your organization, but the most common method involves the following six steps:

**16.2.5.1 Assess your current state**

The first step in any process improvement initiative is to figure out where you are today. This can be done by mapping your current processes.

“Process maps help you understand your current workflows and allow you to spot opportunities for improvement (if any)."

Ragone says this is the most important step in all forms of process improvement.

Walk through your current business processes with the people involved. Document every step (even those you deem irrelevant). Write down the order your people complete those steps in through the end of the process. 

Next, create a flow chart using a process mapping tool to show your ordered process’ steps so you can see every detail with a birds-eye view

Then identify the role responsible for each step in your process and the tools used. Project management tools, like Asana, can help with this process. Remember, continuous improvement is about your tools and materials, people and relationships, and environment.

You should begin to spot gaps and opportunities for improvement now.

**8. Celebrating Customer Success:** 

Recognizing and celebrating customer success stories can inspire and motivate team members. When they see the positive impact of their work on customers, it reinforces their commitment to delivering excellence.

By integrating the focus on the customer concept into team building efforts, teams can become more customer-centric, resulting in improved customer satisfaction, loyalty, and overall business success.
