**9.2 Responsibilities:**

**9.2.1 Definition:**
 Responsibilities are the specific tasks, duties, or functions that an individual or position is accountable for within their assigned role.
Responsibility refers to the duty of having authority or control over something or someone.  If you are responsible for something, you will be held accountable for the outcome of what comes from it, as this was your duty.

For quality management systems it is important that you take responsibility for your actions. This  will show that you are serious about the job at hand, and will demonstrate integrity and ownership.

Most organisations have built-in responsibilities, whether these be related to their employees, customers or society at large.
 
Being responsible for things is hard to avoid, and the more your organisation owns this responsibility, the better off they will be.

In particular, organisations have a responsibility to ensure the health and safety of their employees at work. If an organisation chooses to ignore this responsibility for any given reason, the consequences for them could be catastrophic.

**9.2.2 Characteristics:**
 Responsibilities outline the specific actions or outcomes expected from an individual to fulfill their role effectively.

**9.2.3 Examples:** 
A project manager's responsibilities may include project planning, stakeholder communication, and overall project coordination.

The term "clarity" is often used to describe the quality or state of being clear, transparent, or easily understood. 
In various contexts, clarity can refer to different aspects:

**Transparency or Clearness:**
 In a literal sense, clarity may refer to the quality of being transparent or clear, such as clear water, clear glass, or a clear sky.

**Clearness of Expression or Thought:** 
In communication or writing, clarity relates to the ability to express ideas in a straightforward and understandable manner. It involves avoiding ambiguity, vagueness, or confusion in language.

**Accuracy and Precision:**

Clarity can also pertain to the accuracy and precision of information or data. A clear presentation of facts or details helps ensure that there is no misunderstanding or misinterpretation.
