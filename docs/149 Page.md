Human transformation hinges on the idea that we can better ourselves and our organizations.

So when it comes to the continuous improvement process (Plan, Do, Check and Act or PDCA), it’s an investment in reaching our full potential. 

This journey isn’t a one-size-fits-all when it comes to implementing improvement strategies or improvement techniques. It’s a deliberate process that requires observation, analysis, planning, and action. 

But continuous improvement also is built on the idea that coaching can help people — and organizations — along the way. Like coaching, continuous improvement is an ongoing effort. It’s built on a foundation of teamwork, a strong company culture, and feedback. But it also requires support and continuous improvement tools to help keep skills and capabilities sharp. 


At BetterUp, we believe everyone has the potential to grow and transform. We know businesses are made up of people. So when you invest in your people, you invest in the success of your organization.

Sometimes, continuous improvement is the smallest change that adds up over time. Other times, continuous improvement goes hand-in-hand with adapting to change and building resilience to stay competitive in today’s market. Regardless, the process generates results without the pain that comes with making big changes at once.

If it seems like there's room for improvement at work, or if you want to become an industry leader who stays ahead of the curve, use continuous improvement as a framework for making positive changes.
