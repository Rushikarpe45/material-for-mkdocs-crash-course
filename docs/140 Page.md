**4. Team is Performing**

As the team continues to work efficiently and is not anymore threatened by the appearance of new issues, they enter the Performing stage.

A team reaches this stage of the team development cycle as it matures. At this point, everyone is working together towards a common goal and producing predictable results regularly. If new issues arise, they no longer threaten the team’s performance but are dealt with constructively.

This is the golden age of any team and the goal of what you should aim for. It is marked by clear structure, unified goals, and, most importantly, steady results. There is no saying how long it will take for each team to get here, but you can certainly help your team move through the stages with previous advice.

**Tip:**

Assist your team in continuing the great work by mixing the team roles. A high-performing team is made up of strong professionals that can share valuable insight into the process. Thus, do not be afraid to mix up their roles occasionally. For example, ask someone else to run the weekly meeting to get a different perspective and fresh ideas.

This can lead to new insights, improved problem-solving, and increased creativity within the team. Additionally, it gives the person who takes on the new role an opportunity to enhance their leadership and facilitation skills.

**5. Team is Adjourning**

At one point or another, every team reaches the endpoint and enters the Adjourning stage.
For teams that were gathered for a specific purpose, this final stage will begin as the goals will be reached and work will start winding down. 

Others may continue working but could lose several members, thus changing the overall team dynamics. Either way, this is a point in the team development lifecycle that the team as we know it ceases to exist.

**Tip:** 

Help your team navigate this transition by appropriately marking this stage. The Adjourning stage is often a bittersweet time for the team. While it marks the end of their collaboration, it’s also an opportunity to reflect on their successes and growth.

Therefore, consider holding an event or at least a short meeting to gather everyone from the team one last time and thank them for the job that has been done. By doing this, you will send them onto new projects with new energy and motivation.
