How to do the team building process

**3.1 Form the team**

Step one is to form your team. Whether this step involves hiring, re-organizing current company structure, or a mixture of both, you should select team members of varying skills and experiences that compensate for each other’s weaknesses and complement each other’s strengths.

Also, you should consider teammates’ personalities and work styles. You want to minimize but not necessarily eliminate conflict. Teams that clash and bicker will make little progress, while teams that never disagree may fail to examine matters from multiple perspectives. You should aim for balanced teams. 

Remember that your teams do not need to be perfect right out of the gate. In fact, few, if any teams will gel instantly. Team building takes time and practice, but can improve your team’s dynamics. Yet team building is no miracle cure. Team activities alone may not fix teams with incompatible skill levels and dispositions, so better to select the right members for your tam from the get go.

**When choosing your teammates, you should analyze your current team makeup and identify any gaps.**

Consider what you want your team to achieve and which abilities will help the team reach those goals.
