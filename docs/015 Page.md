**3.6 Foster accountability and acknowledgment**

This step ties in with clarifying roles and responsibilities. A team member must not only understand expectations and positions, but must also follow through on those duties. For a team to function effectively and maintain trust, each teammate must own individual contributions. When teammates fulfill promises and deliver consistent quality work, the team can reach goals without hitting slowdowns or snags.

To foster accountability on your team, you should aim to create a safe environment where employees are not afraid to own up to mistakes and admit shortcomings. You can actively encourage your crew to reach out to teammates for help and advice, as opposed to shouldering the burden alone and underperforming.

 You should address missteps, but it helps to frame the conversation as “what could you have done better?” instead of “what did you do wrong?” In its best form, accountability is more an opportunity for improvement than a punishment. You do not correct an employee to embarrass, but rather because the whole team depends on individual effort.

The New York Times Business guide to building a successful team sums up the sentiment best with a great quote from Shopify executive Tobi Lütke: “Every time you work with someone at the company, the trust battery between the two of you is either charged or discharged, based on things like whether you deliver on what you promise.”

On the other side of the coin, it is also important for the team to recognize a job well done. By acknowledging accomplishments and achievements as a team, you motivate your people to deliver their best work and boost employee morale. You can promote acknowledgement by starting rituals like team kudos, where each team member shares a compliment about a colleague via anonymous post-it-note or shout-out on a team chat.

**3.7 Assess progress**

As you progress through the team building process, you should periodically measure your team’s growth. At this point, you may decide to revisit your baseline and assess which teamwork competencies your group mastered, and which could use more work. Feel free to reinforce any teamwork skills you feel your team could still enhance.

You can assess progress by asking for feedback from your team. You can ask your team to fill out individual evaluations using programs like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms, or you can prompt a frank discussion during a meeting so that you can analyze the situation together. Feel free to ask your team

**3.8 Celebrate successes and improve on shortcomings**

Team building requires effort, and when you achieve success in any or many of the team building steps, you should take time to acknowledge the win. In fact, experts encourage you to celebrate small wins with the team consistently. 

Acknowledging headway re-energizes and motivates the team and helps prevent burnout. By recognizing that your hard work produces results, you inspire your employees towards continued excellence. However, you need to praise the achievements in a timely manner so that employees can feel the full benefits.

You should also move fast to correct shortcomings. If you delay making improvements, then your team may lose momentum. The best time to improve is when you first discover a flaw. The sooner you revamp your approach, the sooner your team can flourish. Feel free to return to any of the previous steps as many times as necessary.
