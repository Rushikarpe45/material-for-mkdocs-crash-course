**15.7 Reflect on Your Conflict Management Skills:**

Consider what you did well and where you could improve after handling a conflict situation in your team. Solicit feedback from the team members involved to find out how effective they felt you were at helping resolve the situation.

Now think about structural or procedural improvements you can make to prevent future conflict. These could be:

Setting clear goals for every team member â€“ when people experience the right amount of pressure, they perform well.

Make sure that people's responsibilities match their skills. Offer learning and development opportunities to plug skills gaps and help your people to realize their career aspirations.
Using regular one-on-ones to sound out potential sources of future conflict.

As the CIPD concludes, the key to resolving conflict is to, "Build an environment in your team that is open, respectful, kind, fair and consistent, in which people feel 'psychologically safe.'"
