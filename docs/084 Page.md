Setting boundaries at work involves a two-step process: effectively communicating what your boundaries are and taking action to ensure that your team respects them. For example, let's say that you do not want to respond to emails you get after 6 p.m. First, you'll need to notify your team about your availability after-hours.

 Then you'll need to take additional steps, such as adding a note to the bottom of your emails as a reminder and not responding to any emails you get after work.

How to set boundaries at work
Before you begin thinking about the boundaries you need to set, take time to reflect on your job, your office, your coworkers, your manager, and your day-to-day tasks. Of those areas, what doesn't feel like it's working well for you?

Identify the problem (or problems) so you have a clearer understanding of where you need to set boundaries. For instance, maybe you work in a different time zone than your manager, who often emails you during their work hours expecting an immediate response when it's much later for you.

Once you know where you need to focus your efforts, you can follow the tips below to begin establishing better boundaries at work.
