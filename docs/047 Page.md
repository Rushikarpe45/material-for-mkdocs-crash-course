**Example**

of the plant team role: Plants are highly creative, which is why they would make great product designers.
Monitor evaluator
Another thought-oriented team role is the monitor evaluator. This type is a rational thinker and can put their emotions aside for problem solving.

 Monitor evaluators work best when their projects require advanced knowledge and strategic planning. They assess ideas to determine if they are valuable and viable, then take the steps to push those ideas forward. 

**Example** 
of the monitor evaluator team role: Monitor evaluators are your hyper-organized project managers, strategically scoping projects and connecting the dots across teams. 
Specialist

The last thought-oriented team role is the specialist. Specialists have in-depth knowledge in their field and they like to contribute to one area of expertise. Specialists follow the pattern of all the thought-oriented team roles in that they work better alone than in a group. Although this individual is more independent, they provide a lot of value to the team with their specific skill set.

**Example** 

of the specialist team role: Specialists may be your coders, your SEO analysts, or your technical crew on the team—their job is specialized on a skill the rest of the team may not know much about, and thankfully they have it covered. 

Coordinator Moving on to the people-oriented team roles, the coordinator is a team member with great communication skills. Coordinators are often in leadership positions because they promote collaboration and motivate the team to accomplish their goals. Other team members look up to coordinators and trust them to make a decision. 

Example of the coordinator team role: Coordinators enjoy collaborating and motivating others, so they’d thrive as the lead of a team of product developers.
 
**Teamworker**
 Teamworkers are also people-oriented. Their extroverted personalities help them function well with others and listen to their teammates. These team members can adapt easily to changes in their environment and they know how to create harmony if conflict arises. If one team member has too much on their plate or another has a family emergency, teamworkers are the first to step in and offer support.
  
Example of the teamworker team role: Because teamworkers are natural collaborators, they’d excel as a product marketer within a larger team.

**Resource investigator**

The last of the nine team roles is the resource investigator. These people-oriented individuals enjoy exploring new opportunities like finding potential marketing opportunities for the company or chatting up stakeholders for a new product launch. Their positive attitude makes them a natural networker or facilitator of new business. 

Example of the resource investigator: Because resource investigators like to network with others, they’d thrive in product sales.
