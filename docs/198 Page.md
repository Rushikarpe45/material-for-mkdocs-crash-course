**16.6 Advantages of team building** 

 We have written a lot in other posts about the advantages of team building. Overall, the greatest advantage of team building is that it makes your team more effective. This means that teams are productive while maintaining good communication and developing healthy relationships with each other. It’s a combination of “getting the job done” and trust. 

Team building activities accomplish this by challenging teams in these areas, making them aware of the areas  that are strong and the areas that need more work. This feedback and knowledge, combined with the fun memories that they share during the activity, allows teams to continue to develop and grow stronger in the future. 

This is clearly an overview of the process and the advantages of team building. Here are some more specific advantages to team building (there’s a lot so we will list them for easy convenience).

• Get to know colleagues better
• Build trust and inclusivity among the team
• Motivate team members
• Stimulate creativity and empower new ideas
• Learn new skills and processes
• Become better problem-solvers
• Increase team unity
• Decrease stress and have fun together

**16.7 Disadvantages of team building: concerns to think about**

Along with the advantages listed above, there are a number of disadvantages. But don’t think of them as essential to all team building programs. Rather, these are possible concerns that could turn metastasize into disadvantages when they are not considered. 

Moreover, by being aware of these disadvantages, you can avoid them and choose programs that are more suited to your team’s needs and personality. 

**16.7.1 Team building activities can be very expensive:**

Team building events can be quite costly and if you want to spend money, the sky’s the limit. You might feel the pressure to spend more money on blowout events or high-priced group trips. Of course, only very few companies in the world have the budget to fly their teams to a tropical island retreat for team building. 

In reality, there are many more affordable options that will probably be as effective, if not more so. Smaller events with teams might be better than huge events. Likewise, expensive training sessions and coaches may not be what your team really needs. You have to weigh the costs against what the program provides and what your team is looking for.

And if your budget is really tight, we still recommend implementing some sort of team building. This can be organized on your own–small group chats, outdoor picnics, impromptu office parties or lectures, etc. No matter what you can afford, putting in the effort into team building now will greatly benefit your team down the line.


**16.7.2 Team building activities are time consuming and need to be held regularly:**

Team building exercises can be very time consuming both in their planning and execution. Also, it should be kept in mind that one single event will not have the long lasting effects that you may want–team building is a constant effort that needs to be worked on regularly. 

The time-consuming nature of team building exercises might be a serious concern for you and your team. You might not think that your team has any time to spend on team building, or that team building will take away time from more “productive” tasks.

In reality, team building is an excellent use of time and will help your team be more productive later on. However, the stereotype that team building is a waste of time comes from the fact that sometimes teams choose activities that are not worth the team’s time. 

So the number one solution is to find activities that will be beneficial and help your team. This requires a good assessment of where your team is at and where it wants to go.
