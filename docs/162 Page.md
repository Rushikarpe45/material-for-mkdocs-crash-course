**16.2.3.2 The Kanban method**

The Kanban method is a framework that helps you visualize your work and optimize your workflow. The key principle of Kanban is to break down your work into smaller tasks and then track the progress of each task through every stage of your workflow. This helps you identify bottlenecks and areas of inefficiency so you can make improvements.

The Kanban method is a framework used in team building and project management to visualize work, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. 

Originally developed by Toyota in manufacturing, Kanban has been adapted for knowledge work and is widely used in software development, IT operations, and various other industries. Here's how the Kanban method can be applied in team building:

**1. Visualize Workflow:** 

Teams begin by visualizing their workflow on a Kanban board, which typically consists of columns representing different stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Each task or work item is represented by a card on the board, moving from left to right as it progresses through the workflow.

**2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP):** 

Kanban emphasizes limiting the amount of work in progress to prevent bottlenecks and maintain a smooth flow of work. By setting WIP limits for each stage of the workflow, teams can focus on completing tasks before starting new ones, thereby reducing multitasking and improving overall efficiency.


**3. Manage Flow:** 

Teams continuously monitor the flow of work on the Kanban board, ensuring that tasks move smoothly from one stage to the next. If bottlenecks or delays occur, team members collaborate to address them promptly and keep the flow of work moving steadily.

**4. Make Policies Explicit:** 

Kanban encourages teams to make their workflow policies explicit and transparent. This includes defining criteria for moving tasks between stages, prioritizing work, and resolving blockers. By clarifying these policies, teams can reduce ambiguity and improve coordination.
