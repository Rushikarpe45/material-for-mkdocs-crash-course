**7. Avoid gossip.**

If you feel drained when your colleagues complain about some aspect of work, then it may be useful to set a boundary with them. 
You get to decide what that looks like. Perhaps you enjoy venting a little bit, but your coworkers often go too far. Or perhaps you'd rather focus on the positive aspects of your work rather than the negative.

**Either way, you can tell your colleagues about your preferences:**

Take time off when it's offered—and when you need it. A long weekend here and there or a week away with loved ones can help you recharge. 

**10. Reassert your boundaries when people cross them.**

Setting boundaries isn't a one-time occurrence. Chances are, someone at work will cross your boundaries (or ignore them), so it's important to reassert them, reminding people about your needs and expectations.
