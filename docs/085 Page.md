**1. Start with small boundaries.**

If you're not used to setting boundaries in the workplace, it helps to start small and build from there. Rather than make sweeping changes, you can begin with a few small steps to protect your time or environment at work. 

**2. Build breaks into your schedule.**

It’s easy to sit down at your computer and get caught up in a task. But breaks can help energize you. If you use a digital calendar, add a lunch break so your colleagues can’t schedule meetings during that time.

If possible, block out time on your calendar throughout the day or week to get your work done. A hold on your digital calendar lets your team and others know you're unavailable at those times, and gives you uninterrupted time to focus on your tasks. 

**3. Prioritize your work tasks.** 

When you have a heavy workload, you may need to prioritize your tasks. When you have too many tasks and not enough time to complete them, start by deciding which tasks are most urgent. Then, if possible, determine which tasks you can delegate to others on your team or seek more time to complete.

However, if prioritizing and delegating tasks is not enough, speak with your manager about your workload and see if there's room to set aside a certain project while you focus on the most important priorities. 

**4. Use digital tools to help.** 

A good deal of office work relies on digital tools to help foster productivity. Think about ways you can use the tools your company already offers to establish boundaries. 
For example, if you’re working on an important task and don’t wish to be disturbed, put up an away message on Slack and turn off notifications.

There are also a number of apps that help you minimize distractions, such as Freedom or KeepMeOut, that may help you block out your time while you work. 

**5. Delay your response time.**

Thanks to email and other virtual tools, you may feel pressure to be available or respond to communication quickly during—and even after—work hours. But, unless a message is extremely urgent, that demand may interrupt the structure you’re attempting to create—and can distract you from more important tasks.

Where possible, delay how quickly you respond to emails and other requests. Dedicate time throughout the day to checking your email, but avoid responding outside of those blocks. 
If you work in a different time zone than others on your team, add a note to your email setting expectations about your availability or response time, such as I am sending you this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.

**6. Only say "yes" when you mean it.**

Without boundaries, it's easy to grow resentful. Saying “no” is important because you may be asked to participate in tasks that you do not have time for, such as attending an extra meeting, taking on a last-minute project, or heading a new committee. 

When you do say “no,” start on a positive note. For example: "I would really be interested in handling the Johnson account, but I'm wondering if I could pass the Holt Industries file on to Jim to make time for it?"
