**6.2 Improves employee engagement**

If you want to improve employee engagement in your workplace, having a clear, concise, and consistent set of communication practices in place is crucial.

Effective team communication clears employee doubts and helps them brainstorm ideas and doubts with their peers and managers. Team communication encourages a culture.
 
Recognition is a great way to motivate employees and boost their morale. When you foster a culture of strong internal team communication, team members acknowledge each other’s accomplishments. It creates a sense of belonging among the team members, which keeps them more engaged and satisfied.

**6.3 Impacts employee wellbeing**

Employee wellbeing is critical for an organization to succeed. If your workforce is not physically and psychologically healthy, it directly impacts their performance.

Employees’ productivity can drop when they are not in regular contact with their colleagues and team leaders. When team members feel undervalued because they aren’t receiving the interactions they need, they will also feel unwell.

In addition, most of the global workforce has adapted to the remote or hybrid work culture after the pandemic. The sudden shift has changed the team dynamics since employees can no longer communicate in person, resulting in stress and anxiety. 

People have psychological needs; they want to be understood, validated, and accepted. In a workplace culture, it’s the same.

When employees keep open communication and share their experiences related to any issues, it keeps them emotionally healthy. Finding ways to bridge that gap and providing the right remote communication tools is the key.

**6.4 Brings more innovation**

In this digital economy, companies from all sectors must find innovative ways to sustain and reinvent themselves. One can only achieve that with good communication and active listening practices.

A workplace has diverse people from different backgrounds and ethnicities. Their life experiences and perspectives allow them to look at an existing problem with clear lenses.

We can only benefit from it if they are allowed to build a culture of strong communication. Creating a company culture of openness and encouraging employees to share their ideas and views helps companies to make better decisions and bring innovation. Innovation is unlikely to occur in an organization lacking open communication because it is a significant factor that drives it.
