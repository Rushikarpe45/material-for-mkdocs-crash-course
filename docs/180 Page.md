Goals should be relevant to the team's overall objectives and aligned with the organization's mission and vision. Ensure that the goals directly contribute to the team's success and are meaningful in the context of its work. 

Avoid setting goals that are unrelated or irrelevant to the team's purpose or priorities.

**5. Time-bound:** 

Goals should have a specific timeframe or deadline for completion. This creates a sense of urgency and helps prevent procrastination.

Additionally, regularly reviewing progress against SMART goals allows for adjustments and ensures that the team stays on track toward achieving its objectives.
