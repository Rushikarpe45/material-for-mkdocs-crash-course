**6. Focus on Delivering Value:** 

Agile methodology emphasizes delivering value to customers early and often. In team building, this translates to prioritizing activities and initiatives that have the greatest impact on team effectiveness, productivity, and success. 

By focusing on delivering value, teams can maximize their impact and achieve meaningful results.
**7. Continuous Improvement:** 

Agile encourages teams to reflect on their processes and performance regularly and identify opportunities for improvement. 

In team building, this involves conducting retrospectives or post-mortems after each project or iteration to assess what went well, what could be improved, and how to enhance team performance moving forward. By embracing a mindset of continuous improvement, teams can learn from their experiences and become more effective over time.

By applying Agile principles in team building, organizations can create high-performing teams that are adaptable, collaborative, and focused on delivering value to customers and stakeholders.


## **16.2.4 Why is continuous improvement important?**

**16.2.4.1 Increased efficiency and productivity**

Because you’re constantly identifying areas where your processes can be improved, you can create a more streamlined workflow that cuts down on wasted time and resources. As a result, your team will be more productive.

**16.2.4.2 Improved employee engagement and relationships**

As Ragone stated, continuous improvement focuses on people and relationships just as much as it focuses on tools. The feedback loops in continuous improvement mean that employees watch out for opportunities for improvement in communication. 

When employees feel like they are a part of a continuous improvement process, they are more engaged and invested in the success of the company. And you’ll have better relationships between employees and managers and a more positive work environment overall.
