**1. Foster communication**

Fostering communication between yourself and your team is a great way to build trust. Having a set platform to communicate on and using it frequently can help your team members feel as informed, updated and involved in the project as possible.

 This may increase trust among yourself and your team, as it allows everyone to stay informed if things change within the project or team and work together to find a solution.

**2. Try to be transparent**

Trying to remain as transparent as possible with your team can help you maintain a level of trust in the workplace. For instance, if you have concerns about the progress that the team's making, it may be helpful to share these concerns with team members.

 Additionally, if you believe that a certain project is going to take longer than expected, you can convey this information to the team so that everyone understands the project's timeline.


**3. Meet with individual team members**
Meeting with each team member individually can help you get to know each staff member. Doing so can create a sense of trust better team members and yourself and allow you to gain insight into who they are, both professionally and personally. 
Likewise, each team member can learn the same information about you, which can help you build positive and trusting work relationships.


**4. Conduct team-building activities**
Conducting team-building activities can be helpful for bringing team members together in ways that aren't necessarily focused on work. Team-building activities often consist of fun, brief games or activities such as scavenger hunts, trust games and sharing games. 
Team members can participate in these activities by themselves or on a team, and they often provide an outlet to speak freely and get to know other people on the team in a fun, safe and professional environment.

**5. Encourage collaboration**

Encouraging collaboration among team members can help them feel more comfortable with you and each other. While collaborating, people might grow more comfortable with each other and learn to work with each other in an efficient and effective manner.

 Encouraging team members to complete tasks together or work on their individual tasks at the same time can also help them build relationships.

**6. Show your appreciation**

Actively showing your team members how much you appreciate them may help you earn their trust. Emphasizing what they bring to the workplace and what you value about them can show them why they're important to the team. 

Doing so can also help you form positive relationships with team members and encourage them to continue producing good work.

**7. Exhibit leadership qualities**

Exhibiting leadership qualities can help draw team members to you and enable them to trust you and other members of the team. It can be helpful to model the specific behaviors and skills that you'd like to see your team members exhibit.

For instance, you might hope to have team members learn a new computer software during the duration of a team project. In this case, you may exhibit leadership qualities by becoming completely fluent in the new computer software so that you can offer learning sessions to team members and offer your help if team members need assistance.

If you're a team leader or manager, then you already know how important it is to build trust within your team.

Trust is the foundation that allows teams to collaborate more effectively — the glue that makes teams more than the sum of their parts. Of course, building trust isn't always easy — especially if you're starting from scratch with a new team, or working across timezones, borders, and even hemispheres.
