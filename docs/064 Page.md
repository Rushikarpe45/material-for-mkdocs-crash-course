**11.1 What does it mean to build trust on your team?**

Building trust on your team means actively trying to form positive and trusting relationships with those on your team in the workplace. 
You can build trust on your team by performing a variety of activities that allow an atmosphere of openness, honesty and comfort, such as collaborating on a project or playing games together.
 Doing so may foster success and encourage people to work together toward a common goal for the good of each other and for the company at which they work.

It's important to build trust on your team in the workplace for a wide variety of reasons. For instance, if there's a high level of trust on your team, members of your team can likely feel more comfortable communicating with each other, which is essential to executing successful products.
 Additionally, if there's trust on your team, team members might be more likely to want to work together in a cohesive and organized manner, which might increase your team's progress and create an overall positive work environment.

Building trust on your team can also allow team members to be open and honest with each other, which can be invaluable when any issues or challenges arise.

This is because if team members trust each other, they're often likely to want to work together, rather than individually, toward a common goal in a time-efficient and effective manner.
