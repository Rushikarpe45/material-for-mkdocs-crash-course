**2.6 Building the Ultimate Team**

Now, as you know how to spot the signs of positive dynamics in your team, let’s get to the strategies on how to develop such a team effectively.

**2.7 Get to Know Your Team**

Starting with positive thinking development strategies without getting acquainted with your team will result in failure. Therefore, before applying any practical techniques to team development, do this one thing: study your team.

But how? In all likelihood, you’re not a psychologist, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be observant. Here’s how to understand your team better:

-Observe your team during the working process and at breaks. Watch the way they communicate and solve problems. This gives you a better understanding of their current interactions and how they work together.

-Have individual interviews with team members. Let them share their concerns and feelings about the project and team they work in. Encourage open discussion.

 -Interview team-related employees such as line managers and others to see their point of view on the effectiveness of your team.

As you conduct the study, you’ll understand better any pain points within your team or weaknesses in communication. That allows you to address any underlying issues and solve them before they become critical.

**All teams have different problems. However, some of the most common include:**

Inefficient leadership. This is when your team needs a stronger leader who will delegate tasks, define project development direction, and estimate the accomplished work more effectively.

Groupthink and authoritative approach. This is the opposite of weak leadership and is when team members feel uneasy in expressing their opinions and contributing to the project. For example, when team members are punished for their mistakes or for disagreeing with the team leader.

Lack of interest when some team members aren’t involved with a project and throw parts of their work on other colleagues. As a result, several members of the team do all the work on a project.

Psychological discomfort. This is when team members hide their feelings or are motivated at work by their emotions. They may have hidden aggression, recognition-seeking, or negative attitudes. All of these result in poor communication of information and a bad attitude towards a project.
