**5. Implement Feedback Loops:** 

Kanban promotes the use of feedback loops to continuously improve processes and performance. Teams regularly review their Kanban board to identify areas for improvement, gather feedback from stakeholders, and make adjustments to their workflow or policies as needed.

**6. Continuous Improvement:** 

Kanban is rooted in the principle of continuous improvement, known as "Kaizen." Teams are encouraged to experiment with new ideas, measure their impact, and incorporate successful changes into their workflow.


By embracing a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation, teams can steadily improve their effectiveness and efficiency over time.

**7. Collaboration and Transparency:** 

Kanban fosters collaboration and transparency within teams by providing a shared understanding of the work and its progress. 

Team members can easily see who is working on what, the status of each task, and any potential blockers or dependencies. This transparency promotes accountability and enables effective communication and collaboration.

By applying the Kanban method in team building, organizations can improve workflow visibility, optimize resource utilization, and foster a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration.
