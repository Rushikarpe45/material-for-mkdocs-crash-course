**Team building activities can backfire and cause the opposite effect:**

While team building activities are intended to improve communication between team members and strengthen relationships,  it also has the potential to do the opposite–like when, for example, the activities are too competitive. 

These types of activities can also amplify feelings of superiority among team members or between departments. Furthermore, when there are serious animosities between team members, forcing them into a team building activity together can make things worse. 

Because of this, you should be careful about how to frame the team building exercise. If they feel like implicit criticisms or punishment for a seeming lack of teamwork, such activities will most likely have the opposite effect. Rather, team building should be framed as a celebration of success, or a way of making teams feel more united

Healthy competition may be fine in some cases but should be kept in check. Finding activities that promote teamwork between teams at the end are also suggested. For example, at Invite Japan many of our activities contain “Final Mission” components, where teams have to unite together to solve the last challenge.  

Finally, if the relationships between individual team members are really strained, a half hearted team building activity is not the solution. In such cases it might be better to consult with a specialist in conflict resolution. Team building should also not be used as a substitute for the daily work it takes to create a happy, healthy, psychologically safe working environment, even if it can teach you how to get there

**Not everybody enjoys team building activities:**

The motivation to participate in a team building exercise may vary drastically from person to person. Some will be excited to improve their workflows and connections with their colleagues, while others might feel uncomfortable because they have to let urgent tasks wait.

Some team members may even be inclined to do some work on the side during  the exercise. At the same time there may be others who will believe that the team building exercise is pointless, and will refuse to participate or bring down the team with their negativity.

To avoid this you should make clear to the participants that for the duration of the team building exercise you do not expect them to get work done. You should also encourage them to close their email programs and work-related browser tabs on their computer. 

If you feel that some team members are not interested in participating, encourage them to let go of their stress for a little while and to join their colleagues. In our experience, sometimes they are just insecure because they did not fully understand the rules of the activity and may need a little extra explanation in order to enjoy the activity together with their teammates.

Negativity can also be a learning opportunity. One of team building’s strengths lies in showing teams things about themselves. Thus, if you see certain members being negative, that can be the basis for future discussions on how to deal with unknown situations or how to deal with crises. 

Other team members might view the team building activity as a break, and while we definitely recommend that team building activities be held in a relaxed framework, it is still vital that the participants actually participate. 

That is why it is important to communicate the goals and expectations of the activity to your team members before starting. That way, everyone can be on the same page from the start.
  
**Not everyone can participate in team building activities:**

Things like an action-packed outdoor event will probably sound appealing to many. However, this will not be the case for everyone. People with physical disabilities might feel excluded, and non-sporty and non-outdoorsy people might feel uncomfortable and embarrassed.  There are so many other factors to consider. Not everybody can swim for example, some people are afraid of heights and so on.
 
If you plan to eat together as a team there are also many pitfalls regarding different dietary restrictions, be it due to allergies, religion, or lifestyle choice. Moreover, if it is a drinking party some members may not like drinking alcohol. 

On the other hand, an online team building event might not be right for everyone either. There might be people who have to share a small living space or need to keep an eye on their young children. Or maybe their internet connection is not great.

Issues like these can be avoided by carefully picking the activity and knowing (or finding out) enough about your team members to be able to take their individual needs into consideration. This should be part of the larger process of assessing your team before choosing a team building event. 

Of course, there is no one team building that will appeal to everyone’s tastes. That’s why switching up the types of team building activities you do is important. That way, team members aren’t stuck doing an activity they don’t like over and over again. This also allows team members to discover new skills or preferences, thus enriching the team.
